# Computational method to artificially insert clusters of microcalcifications in digital breast tomosynthesis

======

This repository contains the training and testing codes for the paper "[Computational method to artificially insert clusters of microcalcifications in digital breast tomosynthesis](https://spie.org/medical-imaging/presentation/Computational-method-to-artificially-insert-clusters-of-microcalcifications-in-digital/12463-102?SSO=1)", submitted to the [SPIE Medical Imaging 2023](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/medical-imaging) conference. We used the [LIBRA](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/libra.html) software from the University of Pennsylvania. Also, we used our in-house software to reconstruct the DBT projections ([pyDBT](https://github.com/LAVI-USP/pyDBT)). Finally, we evaluated the method using a 2AFC test, and the GUI interface is available [here](https://github.com/LAVI-USP/2AFC_Interface).
